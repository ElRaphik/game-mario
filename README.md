# The game
This game is a total rip-off of Mario, and was made with the purpose of discovering js for browsers as well as the engine kaboom.js. 

It is really simplified and there are no animations, but the goal here was to understand the logic etc. 

## Technologies
As said earlier, I used [kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com) as game engine. It is free, so you could use it as well.
It requires basically no installation.

## Play the game
You can try one version of the game [here](https://soranzo.iiens.net) or you can copy the repo and launch it on your own server/locally.
You have to be connected to internet to play, because the sprites I use are not stored in the game's files but on imgur.

## How to play
Use the arrows arrows to move around or go in the pipes. You can also jump with the space bar.

Your goal is to go to the end of a level, which is a pipe, and go down it.

You have to complete all 32 stages to finish.

You will earn points by picking up coins, killing ennemies or just going fast.

To kill an ennemi, just jump on its head as many times as needed.
